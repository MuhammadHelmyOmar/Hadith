# Ideas

Priority 1
- Clustering according to word level and phrase level.
- Comparing topical distribution (LDA, BERTopic)
**- Trying the syntactic language model (probabilistic context-free grammars)**
- Comparing the sentiment

Priority 2
- Analyzing the different styles that capture people's attention or influence them.
- Explainable AI
  - Local Explanations: Techniques like LIME approximate the behavior of complex models with simpler, interpretable models to highlight factors influencing a specific prediction. 
  - Example-Based Explanations: These explanations show similar examples from the data to provide context and help understand the model's actions. 
  - Feature Importance: Methods like SHAP use game theory to assign importance values to input features, showing which ones most influenced a decision. 
  - Counterfactuals: These explanations describe the minimum changes to the input that would lead to a different outcome, helping users understand how to alter a decision.
  - Trying language diffusion models in stylometry (if Llada models destroy the syntactic structure)
  
# Q
- Words are similar in certain dimensions. Can I focus on certain dimensions while clustering?
  - How to identify those dimensions?
