# Ideas
- Analyzing the different styles that capture people's attention or influence them.
- Clustering according to word level and phrase level.
- I might need to lemmatize the words.
- Comparing topical distribution (LDA, BERTopic)
**- Trying the syntactic language model (probabilistic context-free grammars)**
- Trying language diffusion models in stylometry (if Llada models destroy the syntactic structure)
- Comparing the sentiment

# Q
- Words are similar in certain dimensions. Can I focus on certain dimensions while clustering?
  - How to identify those dimensions?

# Readings
- Vector semantics and embeddings from SLP
- Authorship Style
- Appendix G in SLP
